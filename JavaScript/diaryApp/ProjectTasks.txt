Project Description:

Create a web application that allows users to create and manage their personal 
diary entries. Users should be able to sign up, sign in, and securely manage their 
diary entries. Each diary entry should include a title, content, and a timestamp. Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete their diary entries. All data should be stored securely using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

Project Tasks:

Set up a new Firebase project and enable Authentication and Firestore.
Design the user interface using HTML and CSS. The interface should include:
Sign up form
Sign in form
Diary entry list
Form for creating/editing diary entries
Implement Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up and sign in securely.
Create JavaScript functions to handle user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
and interaction with Firestore (creating, reading, updating, deleting diary entries).
